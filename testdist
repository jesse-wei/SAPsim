# This script allows you to test the package
# It uninstalls SAPsim, builds the package, and installs SAPsim locally
# This script should be sourced so that cd works
# Run with . ./testdist

rm -r dist

# There will be only one file
for file in dist/*; do

# Need to test from directory that isn't SAPsim/
# Importing SAPsim stuff from SAPsim directory will import from the SAPsim directory
# Not the pip package
