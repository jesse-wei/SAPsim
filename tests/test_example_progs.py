"""Test example programs.
This code should be the same (or mostly the same, in case it's updated) as the code that autogrades Lab 4.
If you have any questions about RESERVED/RETURN VALUE, they can be answered by reading through this.
If you don't know the test cases your program is failing, you can very easily write a function to check it yourself. It'd probably be exactly the same as what I wrote.
